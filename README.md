# Skelopy
Duplicates a path with its directory structure only. A skeleton copy of the path.

Made the tool to easily replicate the directory structure for my nextcloud instance. (I use external hard drive with specific encrypted paths assigned to all users separately.... so need this to ease the switch of disks when required).

You can use it any way you want.

## Usage
```bash
skelopy /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

## Installation
```bash
cargo install skelopy
```

or just download the binary from the releases page.
